# ReactReduxTraining

React project with the purpose of learning Redux and integrating it with React and React Router v4.

## Installation

Clone the repo, then run
<code>npm install</code>

## Running and Compiling

Run a webserver of your choice with <code>/public</code> as root directory. The project uses Laravel Mix for asset compilation, and I have added NPM scripts to go with it. Change the BrowserSync argument in <code>webpack.mix.js</code> to suit your web server config.

To compile assets, run <code>npm run dev</code>

To compile assets, then watch changes and reload browsers with BrowserSync, run <code>npm run watch</code>
